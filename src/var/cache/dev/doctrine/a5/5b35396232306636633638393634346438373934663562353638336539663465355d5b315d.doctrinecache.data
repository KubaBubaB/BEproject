Create different sales offers, display packs in cross selling areas, select product combinations available for pack sales, simplify stock and VAT management\u2026<\/div>","additionalDescription":"<div><b>A PRECIOUS TOOL FOR ADDITIONAL SALES<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Advanced Pack enables you&nbsp;<b>to increase your average cart value<\/b>&nbsp;by offering your customers the opportunity to purchase a coherent set of products, called a pack, at an attractive price.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>By grouping together products whose simultaneous sale makes sense (such as a camera, its tripod and the appropriate memory card),&nbsp;<b>you guide your customers<\/b>&nbsp;through their buying process, just as you would in a physical store, while&nbsp;<b>saving them time.<\/b>&nbsp;Indeed, by showcasing complementary products on the same page, you save them the hassle of searching for each product individually, with the risk of, for instance, not selecting compatible products. With the pack, they can add multiple items to their cart&nbsp;<b>with a single click,<\/b>&nbsp;ensuring they purchase the correct references.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Thanks to your packs, you also enable your customers&nbsp;<b>to save money<\/b>&nbsp;by offering these product sets at a discounted price. For instance, Advanced Pack allows you to provide one of the products in the pack for free or to offer customized discounts based on the item combinations selected.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Finally, creating a pack allows you&nbsp;<b>to improve the visibility of certain products<\/b>&nbsp;by associating them with your best-sellers.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div><b>A FAST AND INTUITIVE PACK CREATION<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><div><b>Inherit product information<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Select the products to be included in the pack, save: the pack can already be sold on your site with a set of default parameters. Nothing could be faster!<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>All the properties of the products making up the pack are&nbsp;<b>automatically retrieved<\/b>&nbsp;(descriptions, prices, images, features, etc.) to save you time: no need to rewrite descriptions, reinsert images, etc...&nbsp;<b>Advanced Pack<\/b>&nbsp;automatically displays the images and descriptions of the products in the pack in tabs on the product page. You can then customize this display if you want! Your customers can therefore be properly informed about all the products in the pack&nbsp;<b>while remaining on the same page,<\/b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>finalize their purchase with a single click.<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><div><b>Fine management of combinations<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Unlike PrestaShop's native \"pack\" functionality,&nbsp;<b>you don't need to create a pack for each product combination:<\/b>&nbsp;the module's creation tool allows you, for each product to be included in the pack, to choose the combination(s) you want to make available specifically for this mode of sale.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>For example, you can make only certain colors of a product available if it is purchased within a pack. You can also define a default combination for each product, even if it is different from the one defined in your catalog,&nbsp;<b>in order to sell off certain stocks more easily.<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Once your pack is built, your customers are free to select, for each item in the pack, the attribute (color, size, dimension, ...) they want from those you have chosen to make available. They benefit from the same preferential discount defined for the pack, regardless of the chosen combination, even if the combinations have different prices (price impacts on combinations are taken into account).<\/div><div><br><\/div><div><b>Pack Customization<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>In addition to choosing the combinations to be included in the pack, you can let your customers change the quantity of each of the products included in the pack, or set them yourself. Advanced Pack also gives you the option of letting your customers remove a product from the pack, if they want.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Would you like a product to be sold only through a pack? That's also possible! You can even make it a free gift. For example, you can offer an extended warranty for the purchase of a dishwasher. This extension will then be exclusively conditioned to the purchase of the dishwasher.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>With Advanced Pack, the customization possibilities are endless!<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>(*)See conditions in \"Features\" section<\/div><div><br><\/div><div><b>ENCOURAGE YOUR CUSTOMERS TO ORDER IN PACKS WITH A SPECIAL OFFER<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>To encourage your customers to order a product as part of a pack rather than on its own, offer them a benefit they can't refuse! Advanced Pack allows you to create three types of sales offers.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div><b>3 types of sales offers are possible thanks to Advanced Pack:<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><ul><li>Offer a specific discount on each product in the pack<\/li><li>Apply a general discount on all products<\/li><li>Apply a fixed price to the pack, like a psychological price, for example<\/li><\/ul><div><br><\/div><div>In addition to these possibilities,&nbsp;<b>Advanced Pack<\/b>&nbsp;allows you to take into account, or not, the discounts that may already exist on your products. You thus have the choice between:<\/div><div><br><\/div><ul><li>reflecting existing discounts on the sale price of the pack<\/li><li>or, on the contrary, exclude them to favor the discount defined for the pack<\/li><\/ul><div><br><\/div><div>The module also includes&nbsp;<b>a dynamic pack price simulator<\/b>&nbsp;to help you create your sales operation.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>On the customer side, and unlike the native \"pack\" functionality, the sales offer related to the pack purchase is clearly highlighted on the product page. The visitor immediately understands that he can save money by favoring this method.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div><b>QUICK AND EASY ORDER AND INVENTORY MANAGEMENT<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Ordering a pack is managed in such a way that&nbsp;<b>you retain the advantages of ordering separate products.<\/b>&nbsp;First of all, the pack stock is calculated from the stocks of its products. There's no need to define stock at pack level. Each time a pack is ordered, individual product stocks are&nbsp;<b>automatically deducted.<\/b>&nbsp;Then, on the invoice and order details in the back-office, each product appears on a different line, as if it had been ordered separately.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>This has major advantages:<\/div><div><br><\/div><ul><li>No surprises when it comes to stocks: for each product,&nbsp;<b>you have just one stock to manage,<\/b>&nbsp;whether the product is sold on its own or as part of a pack. You avoid the complexities of managing two different stocks for the same product.<\/li><li>Refunds and returns are managed&nbsp;<b>at the individual product level:<\/b>&nbsp;for example, you can refund only one product in a pack, or put a returned product back on sale.<\/li><li>Easy management of products&nbsp;<b>with different VAT rates:<\/b>&nbsp;the invoice displays the tax amount for each different VAT rate.<\/li><li><b>Ability to export pack orders<\/b>&nbsp;to an ERP-type management and analysis system, without having to make any technical modifications to enable it to take pack orders into account.<\/li><\/ul><div><br><\/div><div>Moreover, if one of the products (or a product combination) in a pack is out of stock, the pack will&nbsp;<b>automatically be indicated as unavailable for purchase<\/b>&nbsp;using an availability alert system.&nbsp;<b>No risk of you receiving orders for unavailable products!<\/b>&nbsp;An option also allows you to force the display of another combination if the default combination is out of stock.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div><b>INCREASE PACK VISIBILITY WITH CROSS-SELLING<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>For even greater visibility, you can display a block \"This product is also available in pack\" on the pages of products that are also part of a pack.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>In this way, thanks to a dedicated commercial offer, you can encourage your customers to order the pack rather than the product alone. In short, this is&nbsp;<b>cross-selling:<\/b>&nbsp;an accessible and effective way of&nbsp;<b>increasing your average cart!<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><div><b>POSSIBILITY TO SELL A SAME PRODUCT IN BUNDLES (minimum compatibility PrestaShop 1.7.7.0)<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Do you have products that can be packaged in bundles of several units? Offer your customers the chance to save money by ordering a product in a bundle rather than individually, thanks to a dedicated offer. They'll be able to order the bundle directly from the page of the concerned product.<\/div>","tab":"merchandizing","version":"5.3.4","compatibility":{"from":"1.7.7.0","to":"8.1.2"},"nbRates":"233","product_type":"module","avgRate":"4.2","price":{"EUR":279.99,"USD":317.99,"GBP":243.99},"badges":[{"label":"Modules Partner Creator","img":"https:\/\/medias2.prestastore.com\/themes\/prestastore\/img\/front\/sprites\/badges\/module-editor.png"}],"cover":{"small":"https:\/\/addons.prestashop.com\/616235-pprod\/advanced-pack-create-product-packs-and-bundles.jpg","big":"https:\/\/addons.prestashop.com\/616235-pbig\/advanced-pack-create-product-packs-and-bundles.jpg"},"changeLog":{"5.0.0":["Initial Release (new module)"],"5.0.1":["New: Let a customer to remove a product from a pack (pack must have no discount and at least 3 products)","New: Remove limitation of 2 products mini per pack","New: Better stock management and available quantity calculation","New: Add quantity wanted input on pack page","New: Add view & buy this pack button toggle for cross selling block (+ background color & text color option)","New: Add new option in order to change icons color (plus, remove, reinstate)","New: Add option to only show images from the current combination","Fix: Pack weight calculation","Fix: 404 error on pack update\/add on old PrestaShop 1.5 version","Fix: Use \"Free\" instead of price 0","Fix: Price showing but should not in some cases","Fix: Product accessories and attachments variables for each product of the pack are now available to template","Fix: Filter images that are only \"really used\"","Fix: Hide pack that aren't active into cross selling block"],"5.0.2":["Major fixes and some nice improvements !"],"5.0.3":["Fix wrong price calculation for buy block when not using default combinations and using price impact","Fix product selection (auto complete) when no pack are already created (PrestaShop 1.6.0.11)","Fix tab alert when adding new product (PrestaShop 1.6.0.11)","Fix \"no available carrier\" into shopping cart","Fix pack update on combination change when there is only one product"],"5.0.4":["New: Add \"Pack  - \" prefix when ordering from pack into order detail","New: Compatible with Customer Ratings and Reviews Pro + Google Rich Snippets from Business Tech (version >= 4.0.0)","New: Show pack content detail into Admin Carts tab","Fix issue when saving a product using Store Commander","Fix pack price update when excluding a product","New: Add \"Pack  - \" prefix when ordering from pack into order detail","New: Show pack content detail into Admin Carts tab","Fix issue when saving a product using Store Commander","Fix pack price update when excluding a product"],"5.0.5":["Speed improvement on order","Allow re-order of packs from order history","Allow display of product availablilty (into product pack list, option)","Display reduction percentage\/amount informations into invoice","Fixes on multishop stores","Fixes on customer group with global reduction","Stability improvements and other fixes..."],"5.0.6":["New: Add wanted quantity input when pack product removal is allowed","Fix: show right quantity value into Catalog view (BO)","Fix: price display on PS 1.6.1+","Fix: reduction by amount","Other various fixes & improvements"],"5.0.7":["Fix pack availability status into product list","Fix products URL (anchor) on some PrestaShop versions"],"5.0.8":["Fix eco-tax on combinations","Fix JavaScript error when ajaxCart is disabled","Fix price & tax calculation when using fixed price and cart quantity > 1","Fix warehouse error when creating a pack"],"5.0.9":["Allow pack removal for pack with >= 2 products (instead of 3)","Fix: possible missing tax rules group into order details (PrestaShop >= 1.6.0.11)","Fix: possible wrong availability calculation when using combinations","Fix: currency conversion when using reduction by amount","Fix: inherit out of stock order status and email notification"],"5.0.10":["Performance improvements","Auto-clean old & unused pack data","Various fixes"],"5.1.0":["New display mode available (simple).

It is the promise of <strong>a rise in the amount of orders<\/strong> with total <strong>control of delivery costs<\/strong>.<br \/><br \/>The module allows you to calculate in advance, with the help of precise rules, the necessary conditions for unlocking free delivery. The management and monitoring are done according to carriers, delivery area, price, weight, or any other criteria you term as important for your business.<br \/><br \/>The \u201cFree Delivery Manager\u201d module offers <strong>control of delivery costs<\/strong> by releasing delivery available as a function of criteria you have chosen. All the carriers have their own price list. You may, for example, indicate a minimum order amount by carrier<br \/>In presenting to the customer, in their order summary, the amount remaining before delivery is available, so you definitely encourage them to <strong>order more<\/strong>.<br \/><br \/>Highly detailed statistics visually present two types of reports together. The first one presents the number of orders that have benefited from free delivery, as well as the total and per-order amount that this cost you. You really <strong>control the impact<\/strong> of delivery costs.<br \/>The second report displays the detail of costs caused by free postage and the orders where the rules for free shipping are applied. Thus, the \u201cFree Delivery Manager\u201d module increases the value of transactions as well as the number of orders!<br \/><br \/>This module has been constantly evolving, many thanks to user feedback.
