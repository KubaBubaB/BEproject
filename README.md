## FAQ

#### I want to restart docker, how can I do it?
Deep restart:
in docker desktop remove all the images, all the containers, all the volumes, then:
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

#### What are credentials to myadmin panel?

#### I wanna update my database, how do I do it?

First pull changes from github, then remove volume linked to our database, remove the container with the database(Ideally all volumes, just to be 100% sure) then run everything as instructed in Run Locally section.

#### How to run scripts?

Every script requires python being installed

To run api_uploader:
```powershell
  pip install prestapyt
  pip install requests
  python main.py
```
To run scraper or tester:
```powershell
  pip install selenium
  python main.py
```
